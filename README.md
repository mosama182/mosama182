- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Muhammad Osama. I have a PhD in Electrical Engineering from Uppsala University in Sweden. My research focus was signal processing and machine learning (ML) where I worked on several topics ranging from statistical estimation,
  causal inference to robust ML. My supervisors were [Dave Zachariah](https://www.uu.se/en/contact-and-organisation/staff?query=N13-1398) and [Thomas B. SchÃ¶n](https://user.it.uu.se/~thosc112/index.html). I also worked together with
  [Peter Stoica](https://user.it.uu.se/~ps/ps.html). During my PhD, our reserch got published in NeurIPS, ICML, TMLR and IEEE. My [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Zca4tpwAAAAJ&hl=en).
- ðŸ‘€ I ventured into automotive industry after completing my PhD where I am working with computer vision for occupant monitoring. But I am very interested in research and still trying to find my way. Ideally, I would like to work in an applied research role.  
  I love learning new topics related to ML, signal processing and applied mathematics. And I love learning things from the basics, in simple settings with simple examples and then add on complexity step by step.
  Some of the topics in my mind that I intent to learn: diffusion models, transformers, image reconstruction, conformal prediction, functional analysis, real analysis, optimization etc.  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning diffusion models. I have started with creating simple experiments in Python to understand some of the basic concepts
  on some toy examples [diffusion](https://github.com/mosama182/diffusion_models).
