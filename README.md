- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Muhammad Osama. I have a PhD in Electrical Engineering from Uppsala University in Sweden. My research focus was signal processing and machine learning (ML) where I worked on several topics ranging from statistical estimation,
  causal inference to robust ML. My supervisors were [Dave Zachariah](https://www.uu.se/en/contact-and-organisation/staff?query=N13-1398) and [Thomas B. SchÃ¶n](https://user.it.uu.se/~thosc112/index.html). I also worked together with
  [Peter Stoica](https://user.it.uu.se/~ps/ps.html). During my PhD, our reserch got published in NeurIPS, ICML, TMLR and IEEE. My [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Zca4tpwAAAAJ&hl=en).
- ðŸ‘€ I ventured into automotive industry after completing my PhD where I am working with computer vision for occupant monitoring. But I am very interested in research and still trying to find my way.
  I love learning new topics related to ML, signal processing and applied mathematics. And I love learning things from the basics, in simple settings with simple examples and then add on complexity step by step.
  Some of the topics in my mind that I intent to learn: diffusion models, transformers, image reconstruction, conformal prediction, functional analysis, real analysis, optimization etc.  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning diffusion models. I have come across a good tutorial from some guys at Apple that I am following. I have started with creating simple experiments in Python to understand some of the basic concepts
  on some toy examples. For example, sanity checking that samples from DDPM and DDIM samplers match the data distribution for a toy example with known score function, or plotting trajectories of samples from DDIM for a toy distribution
  in 2D. My goal is to gradually move towards implementing some of the important papers in the field. I have created a repository 'diffusion model' where I push my work and make it public.
